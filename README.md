# Ice_cream_robot

This repo hosts the following:
1. Python script to control an Epson VT6 robot using RoboDK. The robot is programmed to pick up ice cream cones, fill them with ice cream, and then drop them at specified locations. The script ensures that the robot performs the task in a controlled and steady manner, resembling the real-world filling of ice cream.

2. Python code for calculating the end-effector position using the D-H parameters of the robot which was developed with the help of generative AI. 

3. Program generated using the post processor for the epson RC software.
