# Ice_cream_robot


This project contains a Python script to control an Epson VT6 robot using RoboDK. The robot is programmed to pick up ice cream cones, fill them with ice cream, and then drop them at specified locations. The script ensures that the robot performs the task in a controlled and steady manner, resembling the real-world filling of ice cream.
